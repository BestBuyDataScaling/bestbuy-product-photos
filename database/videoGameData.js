      answer: `A: The PS4 Slim outputs games at full 1080p, while the PS4 Pro can output games at up to 4K resolution (2160p). If you have a 4K television, you'll see a noticeable difference in game quality. Note that not all games support 4K, but some will receive updates such as higher framerates, making gameplay smoother.`

Also, if your 10 year old wants to be entertained, this will not work for him/her. It does require a lot of patience, and there are some adult situations that you may not want to subject your child to. But to be quite honest with you I would say NO! IT'S RATED "M" FOR THAT REASON!

    description: `Introducing Nintendo Switch, the new home video game system from Nintendo. In addition to providing single and multiplayer thrills at home, the Nintendo Switch system can be taken on the go so players can enjoy a full home console experience anytime, anywhere. The mobility of a handheld is now added to the power of a home gaming system, with unprecedented new play styles brought to life by the two new Joy-Con controllers.
    PLAY ANYWHERE
    At home the system rests in the Nintendo Switch dock, which lets you play with family and friends on a TV in the comfort of your living room.
    By simply lifting Nintendo Switch from the dock at any time, the system instantly transitions to handheld mode, and the same great gaming experience that was being enjoyed at home now travels with you. The portability of Nintendo Switch is enhanced by its 6.2-inch screen, which displays bright, high-definition gameplay at the park, on an airplane, in a car, or at a friend's apartment.
    Nintendo Switch comes with two Joy-Con that can each act as a standalone controller with an analog stick, a full complement of face and shoulder buttons, built in motion-sensing technology and new HD Rumble. They can be inserted into a Joy-Con grip accessory to be used like a traditional controller, held comfortably in each hand for independent left and right motion controls, or shared between two players for instant multiplayer gaming in front of the TV or out on the go.
    This bundle includes the Nintendo Switch console and Nintendo Switch dock in black, with contrasting left and right Joy-Con controllers-one blue, one red. It also includes all the extras you need to get started.
    If you don’t already have a Nintendo Switch Online membership, you can try it out with a free 7-day trial. Don't worry if you already activated a previous free trial— an additional seven-day free trial is now available.
    Nintendo Switch Online membership and Nintendo Account required for online features. Free trial automatically converts to 1-month auto-renewing membership unless automatic renewal is turned off by the end of the free trial. Credit card/PayPal account required for 18+. Free trial cannot be redeemed by a Nintendo Account with an active Individual Membership or Family Membership. Not available in all countries. Internet access required for online features.

      answer: 'A: I did the same thing with NBA 2k18. Read the fine print. Only one reward per account per title. You won’t get two certificates, only one'

    description: 'Jump into a new Yoshi adventure in a world made of everyday objects - like boxes and paper cups! As Yoshi, you’ll leap up high, gulp down enemies, and set out on a treasure hunt to find all the different collectables. On the flip side, stages can be played backwards, providing new perspectives to explore and new ways to locate some of the more craftily hidden items!
    It all started when Kamek and Baby Bowser set out to steal a gem-set stone. Legend has it that this fabled artifact can grant the bearer their wildest dreams! But when the artifact’s gems are sent flying, it falls upon Yoshi and friends to find them. Luckily, saving the day can be cooperative and challenging. Pass a Joy-Con™ controller to a friend to team up as fellow Yoshis. Also, Mellow mode gives Yoshi wings for a breezier experience, which may come in handy! Finding all the flowers, coins, and Poochy Pups is no small feat! For extra protection, suit up in one of the handicraft costumes you can unlock in-game!',

      question: 'Q: Why is the game called "Yoshi"? Seems awfully generic',
      answer: `A: Yes bestbuy just threw Yoshi as the title for this preorder. Nintendo released gameplay of Yoshi's Crafted World (that's the title for the new switch game). I'm sure bestbuy will update game title when release information is obtained.`

Tackle 164 platforming courses in two main game modes, and enjoy extra replayability with three additional game modes, in which you can also play as a Mii character: Challenges, Boost Rush, and Coin Battle.',
